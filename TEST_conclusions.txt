I tested logs from:

1. v0202 shim - communication between app and shim
- for CD+ (ShimDLL_CD.txt)
- for Mycanic (ShimDLL_MyCanic.txt)

2. CD+ v0202 dll file (ShimDLL_Original_DLL_CD+.txt) - communication between shim and dll

3. CD+ v0404 dll file (Original_DLL_Original_DLL_CD+.txt) -communication between app and dll
CD+ v0404

4. Protocols test for MyCanic

5. Protocols test for CD+

CONCLUSIONS:

1. The v0202 shim filters flag 040 from app to dll
2. CD+ cannot use chan 5 and 6 at the same time (contraty to CD+ manual desrtiption saying it has CAN1 and CAN2 protocols)
3. App do not test J1850 presence, so MyCanic can do the work (!!)
4. App crashes with MyCANIC when it does not accept vendor ID 66816
